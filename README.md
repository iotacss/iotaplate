# iotaPlate

iotaPlate helps you generate the recommended iotaCSS file structure in less than 1 second. Each module file contains all iotaCSS module options for faster configuration. Also, no need to install `iotacss` module. iotaPlate does it for you automatically.


## Installation

```
$ npm install -g iotaplate
```


## Usage

Go to the directory you want the files to be generated to and run:

```
$ iotaplate
```

You are good to go!

**Make sure you have a package.json in your application's root folder. iotaPlate needs that in order to install `iotacss` package.**
